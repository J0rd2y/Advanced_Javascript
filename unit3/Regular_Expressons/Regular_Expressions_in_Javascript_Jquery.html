    <h1>Regular Expressions in Javascript & Jquery</h1>
    
    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    
    <h3>Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec and test methods of RegExp, and with the match, matchAll, replace, search, and split methods of String. This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions.</h3>

    <p>Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes, as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>var re = /ab+c/;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance.</p>
  
  <br></br>
  
    <p>Or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object, as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>var re = new RegExp('ab+c');</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.</p>

    <h2>Jquery</h2>
    
    <p>This Website will show you all the the different types of Jquery Regular Expressions:</p>

    <p>What do they mean when they use the term 'pattern' with Regular Expressions?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Usually such patterns are used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.</li>
      </ul>
