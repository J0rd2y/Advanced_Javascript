  <h1>Define & Describe Jquery</h1>

  <h3>What is JQuery?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>jQuery is a JavaScript library.</li>
    <li>jQuery greatly simplifies JavaScript programming.</li>
    <li>jQuery is easy to learn.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What do they mean by a library?</h3>

  <p>jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling,
    animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. jQuery is designed to change the way that you write
    JavaScript.</p>

  <h3>What are some of the advantages of JQuery?</h3>

  <p>Here is a list of advantages: jQuery is widely used, Promotes simplicity, Cross-browser compatibility,Clean and beautiful syntax,
    Lightweight and lean, Open source library, Animations and cool effects, Highly extensible, Pages load faster,
    SEO-friendly, and Utility features.</p>

  <h3>What are some of the disadvantages of JQuery?</h3>

  <p>The most serious disadvantage of jQuery is that it is overweight kb wise. jQuery is a single JavaScript file
    “jquery.js” which contains
    all its DOM, events, effects, and Ajax components. The file over time and development has gained a substantial
    amount of kb. The first version to come out was 1.2 which had a file size of 77.40 kb and the latest version 2.1.3
    has an uncompressed size of 241.58 kb. Another thing to be kept in mind is that the already large code is ever
    expanding with newer versions. Although the gzipped jQuery file is good with just over 30kb of size, but the
    expanding size is larger than any CSS file and at times larger than an image.
    If a web designer is opting for CSS for his website then performance is not an issue, as CSS is fast but jQuery due
    to its heavy size causes performance issues forcing web developers to pull out their hair in frustration. If a designer
    uses jQuery+ along with jQuery UI, then his first web page will contain at least 300kb of js code only.</p>

    <h3>List and describe three or more examples of JQuery libraries?</h3>

    <h3>How does JQuery relate to and interact with Javascript?</h3>
    
    <p>Uses resources given by JavaScript to make things easier. With JavaScript, one needs to write their own scripting 
      which is time-consuming. With JQuery, one need not write much as scripting already exists. With JavaScript, one needs 
      to handle multiple- browser compatibilities by writing their own code.</p>
